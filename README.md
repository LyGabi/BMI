# BMI
I decided to merge my interests in this exercise.
I plan to create many programs revolving around sports. 

As seen in my Lottery Repository, my exercise consisted of one class. Here I decided to make it more advanced. I created two classes and decided to use constructors,
instances and get and set methods.

I also combined some user input into the code.

Future improvements/ changes plan:

1. Dependant on the if/else statements, the user will recieve guidelines on how to improve their state.
2. Add more choice such as which body type they are, endomorph, mesomoprh or ectomorph
3. Ask the user whether they're cutting or bulking, which will result in additional guidelines.
